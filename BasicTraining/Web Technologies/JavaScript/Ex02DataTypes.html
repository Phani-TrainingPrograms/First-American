        //Js is a dynamic language, so no data types are defined. Everything is var in JS. Its new variations have come up in version 6 with keywords const and let. 
        //let is more scope based compared to var. 
        //const is used for storing data that does not alter. 
        let fruitName = "Apple" //string
        let age = 46 //number
        let currDate = new Date(); //object
        let boolExp = true;//boolean
        let obj = { EmpId : 123, Empname: "Phaniraj" };//object.

        //The internal data type of the variable can be found using typeof operator
        var data; //U have a variable with no initialization.

        console.log(typeof(obj));
        console.log(typeof(data));
        console.log(typeof(value)); //null is an object that has no memory

        //parseInt and parseFloat is used to convert string to int or float respectively.
